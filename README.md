# rzl-gamejam
Attempt at making a simple game in a weekend

setup
=====

    npm install

If you don't use Firefox, you need a local webserver to run the game (cross-origin policy) e.g.:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080


development
===========

Use a typescript editor like VS code or atom-typescript which auto-compiles on save (because of the settings in tsconfig.json)
